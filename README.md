# JavaScript 30 

I undertook a 30-day JavaScript challenge provided by [Wes Boss](https://wesbos.com/) as part of my initiative to 
enhance proficiency in vanilla JavaScript. 
This endeavor was aimed at deepening my understanding of core JavaScript concepts and refining my skill set, with 
the overarching goal of advancing my skills as a frontend developer. (In Progress)
